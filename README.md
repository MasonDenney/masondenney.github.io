This blog is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. The Jekyll theme is based on <https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo>

## Development
Instead of installing jekyll locally to test changes, use 'docker compose up' then visit <localhost:4000> to see your changes. The 'bretfisher/jekyll-serve' image will run 'jekyll build' and 'jekyll serve' and will regenerate once you save changes.
